# XRayMind: Chest X-Ray Prognostics with Explainable AI

<!-- ![XRayMind Demo](demo.gif) -->

XRayMind is an AI-powered diagnostic tool designed to assist medical practitioners in rapidly and accurately diagnosing 14 chest pathologies from X-ray images. Built with **TorchXRayVision** models and enhanced with gradient-based explainability techniques, this project aims to reduce diagnosis time while fostering trust between healthcare providers and patients through transparent AI decision-making.

## Key Features

- **14-Pathology Diagnosis**: Detects conditions such as Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Edema, and more.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Utilizes gradient-based methods (e.g., Grad-CAM) to highlight regions influencing predictions.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Generates GIFs to showcase feature attributions across model layers or iterations.
- **Trustworthy Medical AI**: Provides interpretable explanations to bridge the gap between AI and clinical decision-making.
- **Fast & Scalable**: Optimized for rapid inference using pre-trained TorchXRayVision models.
